# CEP Course material

Materials for students who attended 
[CEP Course](http://www.iitp.ac.in/cep/cep_doc/FDP_LNJPIT_Brochure.pdf)  on 
*Machine Learning and Image Processing* at IIT Patna on 22â€“26 July, 2019.

This repo contains python notebooks used on 5th day of the course on Generative 
Adversarial Networks(GANs) and Adversarial Examples. Rest materials 
can be found [here](https://github.com/nrjcs/mlip).

_NOTE: This repo consist of very basic examples for ML/DL beginners. Thus, 
to make it as easy as possible all examples can be directly run on 
[Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) with Google Drive._

## Files

1. Vanilla GAN
2. DCGAN (Deep convolutional GAN)
3. Adversarial example using Fast Gradient Signed Method (FGSM)

## Exercises for you

1. Use DCGAN to generate [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) like images.
2. Try to break CIFAR10 classifier with FGSM.
